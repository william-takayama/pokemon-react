# Pokemon Challenge

## :triangular_flag_on_post: What is it? 
  Create a responsive single page application using React (library), consuming webservices (GET) that were available on a specific link and filtering data with some filters. It was developed using React Hooks to create components, REDUX to manage states, SCSS on styles, API services using Fetch method, svg and png icons for icons. Libraries such as ReactMaterial, Bootstrap, jQuery or Materilize were not  used in this project. So it's pure coding!

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: What I've learned or improved on my knowledge: 
  - REDUX and how to use it to implement Store, Reducers, actions, selectors and create functions to handle api method GET and handle status related with request, success and error
  - Using React hooks with callbacks to avoid lint warnings
  - Create a loader that is called depending on the application status
  - Create error and success messages
